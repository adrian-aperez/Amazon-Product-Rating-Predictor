## Description

**Product Rating Predictor** is a machine learning application designed to predict Amazon product ratings based on product features (trained on men's hygiene products). 

It uses two specialized models:
- **Modelo_bajo**: For products with **<60 reviews**
- **Modelo_alto**: For products with **>60 reviews**

## Project Overview

1. **Data Pipeline**:
   - Web scraping & external data collection
   - Data cleaning & preprocessing

2. **Exploratory Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Statistical insights
   - Business intelligence visualizations

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Custom data transformers
   - NLP processing (TF-IDF for text features)

4. **Model Development**:
   - Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)
   - Deep Learning experiments
   - Hyperparameter tuning & cross-validation

5. **Deployment**:
   - Streamlit web application
   - Model serving & inference

### Notes:
1. **Screenshot/GIF**:  
   - I used placeholder Imgur links (replace with your actual screenshots/GIFs).  
   - To capture these:  
     - Screenshot: Use Snip & Sketch (Windows) or Screenshot (Mac).
     - GIF: Record with ScreenToGif (Windows) or LICEcap (Mac).
     

2. **Contributing Section**:  
   - Standard GitHub workflow  
   - Encourages collaboration while maintaining code quality  

Want me to adjust any section? For example:  
- Add a "Roadmap" for future features  
- Include contributor badges  
- Expand testing guidelines
